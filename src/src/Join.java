    - build a hash table on dataset-A with 50 buckets (initialize to 0 and null)
    - buckets store the entire record content
    - hashing of each record to know the bucket it is in should be based on the join column
        - the sql command gives the which column is the join column
    - for loop to read dataset-B file-by-file and record-by-record
        - apply same hash function on join column to know the bucket to check from dataset-A
    - if A.RandomV = B.RandomV then output the record with the needed columns
      from the sql command

    - print out the execution time taken to execute the command
    - print out the records that qualify
